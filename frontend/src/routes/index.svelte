    <p>Hello</p>
    <p>This is just a "simple" shop idea I made with <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>,
or more specifically, <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit.</a></p>
    <p>All this essentially is, is a basic shop connected to a database of products that
    automatically updates whenever a new product is added. The product is added to /products
    and when you click on the product, it takes you to an automatically generated page for it.
